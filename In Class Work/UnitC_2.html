			<p>For Christians, Corinth is well-known from the two letters of Saint Paul in the New Testament, <span class="italics">First Corinthians</span> and <span class="italics">Second Corinthians</span>. Corinth is also mentioned in the <span class="italics">Book of Acts</span> as part of the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s missionary travels. In addition, the second book of Pausanias&rsquo; <span class="italics">Description of Greece</span> is devoted to Corinth.</p>

			<p>Ancient Corinth was one of the largest and most important cities of Greece, with a population of 90,000 in 400 BC.<span class="superscript">[1]</span> The Romans demolished Corinth in 146 BC, built a new city in its place in 44 BC, and later made it the provincial capital of Greece.</p>

			<p>Neolithic pottery suggests that the site of Corinth was occupied from at least as early as 6500 BC, and continually occupied into the Early Bronze Age,<span class="superscript">[2]</span> when, it has been suggested, the settlement acted as a centre of trade.<span class="superscript">[3]</span> However, there is a dramatic drop in ceramic remains during the Early Helladic II phase and only sparse ceramic remains in the EHIII and MH phases; thus, it appears that the area was very sparsely inhabited in the period immediately before the Mycenaean period.</p>

			<p>According to Hellenic myth, the city was founded by Corinthos, a descendant of the god Helios (the Sun). However, other myths suggest that it was founded by the goddess Ephyra, a daughter of the Titan Oceanus, thus the ancient name of the city (also Ephyra).</p>

			<h2>Bob Ross Lipsum Example<span class="superscript">&sect;</span></h2>
			
			<p>The very fact that you&rsquo;re aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you&rsquo;re alive and can experience it. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. Let that brush dance around there and play. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long.</p>

			<p>If you don&rsquo;t like it&mdash;change it. It&rsquo;s your world. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. And I know you're saying, &ldquo;Oh Bob, you've done it this time.&rdquo; And you may be right. Do an almighty painting with us.</p>

			<p>Put light against light&mdash;you have nothing. Put dark against dark&mdash;you have nothing. It&rsquo;s the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Let&rsquo;s build some happy little clouds up here. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t be bashful drop me a line. This piece of canvas is your world. That&rsquo;s a son of a gun of a cloud. But we&rsquo;re not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it.</p>

			<p class="green">Have fun with it. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life&mdash;to be able to share this with you.</p>
