			&Tab;Coordinates: 37&deg;54'19"N 22&deg;52'49"E﻿ / ﻿37.9053455&deg;N 22.8801924&deg;E﻿ / 37.9053455; 22.8801924 <strong>Corinth</strong>(/ˈkɔːrɪnθ/; Greek: Κόρινθος Kórinthos) was a city-state (polis) on the Isthmus of Corinth&lsquor; the narrow stretch of land that joins the Peloponnese to the mainland of Greece&lsquor; roughly halfway between Athens and Sparta.

		<p>
			&Tab;For Christians&lsquor; Corinth is well-known from the two letters of Saint Paul in the New Testament&lsquor; <em>First Corinthians</em> and Second Corinthians. Corinth is also mentioned in the <em>Book of Acts</em> as part of the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s missionary travels. In addition&lsquor; the second book of Pausanias&rsquo; <em>Description of Greece</em> is devoted to Corinth.

			&Tab;Ancient Corinth was one of the largest and most important cities of Greece&lsquor; with a population of 90&lsquor;000 in 400 BC.<sup>[1]</sup> The Romans demolished Corinth in 146 BC&lsquor; built a new city in its place in 44 BC&lsquor; and later made it the provincial capital of Greece.
		</p>
		<p>
			&Tab;Neolithic pottery suggests that the site of Corinth was occupied from at least as early as 6500 BC&lsquor; and continually occupied into the Early Bronze Age&lsquor;<sup>[2]</sup> when&lsquor; it has been suggested&lsquor; the settlement acted as a centre of trade.<sup>[3]</sup> However&lsquor; there is a dramatic drop in ceramic remains during the Early Helladic II phase and only sparse ceramic remains in the EHIII and MH phases; thus&lsquor; it appears that the area was very sparsely inhabited in the period immediately before the Mycenaean period.
		</p>
		<p>
			&Tab;According to Hellenic myth&lsquor; the city was founded by Corinthos&lsquor; a descendant of the god Helios (the Sun). However&lsquor; other myths suggest that it was founded by the goddess Ephyra&lsquor; a daughter of the Titan Oceanus&lsquor; thus the ancient name of the city (also Ephyra).
