	<h1>Cover Letter Workshop</h1>
	 <p>Your cover letter is not intended to get you the job, it&rsquo; intended to get your foot in the door. You will eliminate yourself from even being considered for a job if your cover letter is anything less than perfect.</p> 

	<h2>The Mechanics of the Letter</h2>

	<p><strong><em>proofread</em></strong> &ndash; You must proofread the letter at least three time; have someone else proofread the letter &mdash; a second set of eyes can find mistakes that you might miss. 
			Also, you must correct all grammar, punctuation, spelling and typos
	Don&rdquo;t rely on just the spell check feature of a word processor alone. <em>Proofread for meaning</em>.</p>


	<p><strong><em>Paper &ndash;</em></strong> The paper must be at least 20 lb paper, preferably a 100% cotton fiber. A more substantial paper weight of 24 lb would be better. Choose bright white or off-white (beige). Don&rsquo;t choose a color such as red or bright yellow that will actually put off a potential employer. A white or a neutral color works best.</p>

	<p><strong><em>Font &ndash;</em></strong> Don&rsquo;t choose a font face that is hard to read, such as a fantasy font or a script font. Choose Arial or Times New Roman. Arial is a more modern typeface. Times New Roman is a more conservative type face. The more conservative the company, the more likely you would be to choose a serif font, like Times New Roman.</p>

	<h2>Identify your skills and accomplishments</h2>
	<p>Don&rsquo;t embellish. State the truth in simple facts.</p>
		
	<p>For example, you may have started a newsletter, participated in charity events, were the president or an officer of one or more clubs or were the captain of a sports team</p>

			<p>just state what you did and why it mattered to you. All of these types of activities give you experience in leadership and in working as part of a team.
		</p>
	   
	<h2>Tell the Employer Why You Want to Work for the Company</h2>
	<p>Do some research. What makes this company so special? Is it that they are a start-up company and you have a special talent that will help them get off the ground? Is it an established company whose reputation and stability are the attraction?</p> 
		
		<p>Tell the employer that you want to be part of that organization and that it really matters to you that you get the job. However, don&rsquot tell them that you <em>need</em> a job ndash; tell them how <em>their company</em> will benefit from hiring you.</p>
		 
		 <p>If you are using this cover letter to apply to different employers, be sure that you change <em><strong>ALL</stromg></em> references to the company's name</p></em></em>

		<h2>Wrap it Up</h1>

	<p>Thank the reader for his or her time, and invite him or her to contact you. Give them your phone number(s) and email address. Invite the reader to contact you so that you may better explain in greater detail why you are qualified for the position you are seeking. <em>Your gain is their gain.</em></p>
